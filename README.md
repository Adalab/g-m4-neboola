## Vacacioonero Web Application ##

http://beta.adalab.es/g-m4-neboola/

Vacacioonero is a Single Page Application (SPA) developed to help employees request their vacations and check the amount of free days available for them. It's organized in four screens:

    >> Login screen: with a simple login in which the employee enters the app and receives his/her information by introducing his/her email address (@neboola.co)
    >> Profile screen (from Login screen): here the employee can check the amount of free days left and the vacations that he/she has already scheduled (those that he/she requested and were approved).
    >> Information screen (from Profile screen): in this screen the employee can check all the requests made: the ones approved (scheduled), the ones already taken (past) and the ones requested but not confirmed yet (requests). 
    >> New request screen (from Profile screen): in this screen the employee can request new vacations and add a text comment for additional information. 

Vacacioonero has been developed using the following technologies:

    - HTML5 
    - SASS
    - JS ES6
    - React
    - Mobile first design and mediaqueries
    - Event managments
    - React Router
    - Moment.js
    - PropTypes
    - LocalStorage
    - GitHub Pages publication

# What is this?
This project is the final assignment of the fron-end development course from Adalab Digital. We were asked to develop the product that the start-up Neboola had designed. 

# Who are we?
We are a group of five female fron-end developers who have been learning HTML, CSS, JS and React for three months already in Adalab Digital.
